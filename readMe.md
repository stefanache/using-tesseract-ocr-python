Hi,
In this procedure intend to discuss about using tesseract-OCR from python.

The ref by me was this tutorial : https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/07/10/using-tesseract-ocr-python/

Remembr that in https://github.com/stefanache/install_Tesseract4_for_Python3.7 we discuss about 
   -installing Teseract-OCR and then
   -installing "it's "bidings" for python:
      -pytesseract(pip install pytesseract)
      -pillow(pip install pillow)

If you consult in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software) then you find this about tesseract:

Tesseract is an optical character recognition engine for various operating systems.[3] It is free software, released under the Apache License, Version 2.0,[1][4][5] and development has been sponsored by Google since 2006.[6]

In 2006, Tesseract was considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR engines then available
